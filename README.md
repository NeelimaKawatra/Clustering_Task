Right now, I have updated the code to Clustery.ipynb.
**!streamlit run app.py &>/content/logs.txt & npx localtunnel --port 8501 & curl ipv4.icanhazip.com**
This cell, somewhere at last, will give a link and a password. Please click on the link and put the password that came. This way we can make a tunnel to use streamlit on google colab and can use gpu.
